// Number Islands: Problem is in resources folder for this playgrounds page.

// Return the number of islands, which are 1's completely surrounded by water, assume that the borders of the 2d grid are also surrounded by water.


//1 pick a value in center of the grid, loop through, if that value is a 1 then  
//2 flip it to a 0 so that we don't double count it, buildable matrix
//3 Trigger depth first search, to search for neighboring 1's


//? I dont understand the flip from 1's to 0's so that we dont doubly count a 1.
