//238. Product of Array Except Self
//Medium
//
//Given an integer array nums, return an array answer such that answer[i] is equal to the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
//
//The product of any prefix or suffix of nums is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit integer.
//
//You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and without using the division operation.

//Example 1:
//
//Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
//Output: [24,12,8,6]
//Example 2:
//
//Input: nums = [-1,1,0,-3,3]
//Output: [0,0,9,0,0]

// WHAT IS THE PROBLEM ASKING?

// we want to return the product of all the other numbers so for instance nums[1] = 24 because 2*3*3 = 24. Another is nums

let nums = [1,2,3,4]
let answer = [24,12,8,6]

for i in nums {

}
print(answer[0])
