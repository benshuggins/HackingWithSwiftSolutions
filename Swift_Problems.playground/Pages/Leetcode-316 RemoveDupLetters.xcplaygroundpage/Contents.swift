//316. Remove Duplicate Letters
//
//Given a string s, remove duplicate letters so that every letter appears once and only once. You must make sure your result is the smallest in lexicographical order among all possible results.
//
//Example 1:
//
//Input: s = "bcabc"
//Output: "abc"
//Example 2:
//
//Input: s = "cbacdcbc"
//Output: "acdb"

// Lexigraphical order is the order that appears in a dictionary 


class Solution {
    func removeDuplicateLetters(_ s: String) -> String {
        
    }
}
